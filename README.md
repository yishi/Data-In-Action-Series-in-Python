[Data In Action Series 1:  Recognition of  Handwritten Digits](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yishi/Data-In-Action-Series-in-Python/blob/master/data_in_action_series_1.ipynb)

The handwritten digits dataset which we used is made up of 1797 8x8 images. 

Each image is of a hand-written digit. 

Each pixel could be showed as a number.

In order to utilize an 8x8 figure like this, we'd have to first transform it into a feature vector with length 64.

Now, we transform a figure form to an array which has 64 features vector.

We could use all the classification algorithm to recognizing the handwritten digits.
